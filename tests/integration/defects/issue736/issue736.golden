Dear administrator,
 
 The RangeServer rs1 (HOSTNAME) is no longer available and is
 about to be recovered. All ranges of rs1 are moved to other machines.
 After you fixed the failing node please manually delete the file "run/location"
 in the Hypertable directory on HOSTNAME (usually /opt/hypertable/<version>)
 before restarting Hypertable on this node.
 
 Current statistics:
 
 2 server(s) total
 1 server(s) up
 1 server(s) down
 
 Recovery will only continue if at least 0 RangeServers (40%) are running.
 This setting can be overwritten with the parameter
 --Hypertable.Failover.Quorum.
 
 The Hypertable.RangeServer.log logfile on HOSTNAME will have reasons why
 the RangeServer had to be recovered.
